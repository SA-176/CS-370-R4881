Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

The code I was provided on this project was most of the code needed to run the treasure hunt game. Including the code for the map and movement directions. The code I added was finishing the Q-training algorithm so the program could learn as it progressed through attempts in the game. I wrote the save to memory and part that saved existing attempts to the program memory to use when starting another attempt along with providing a bit of randomness to its movements so it wouldn't end up stuck or to static to complete the task. 


Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists write the programs and software to run what we use in the modern world and what we can be using in the future. In intelligent systems development it is just the next major step in computer science that will allow computers to start making decisions based off prior data and learn how to do it better. A huge step that can help almost every industry and life when applied correctly. 


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

My first step to approaching a problem as a computer scientist is to review all the information I am given and how that information can be used to solve the task ahead of me. I will graph or write out all the information I have and what I can infer from the task and apply that to finding a solution that fits the task goal given what I have to work with. 


What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

My ethical responsibilities to the end user is to create a program that can't be used to harm others or exploit others without their knowledge. To the organization the responsibility is to program a working, clean, and well written piece of code or program that satisfies the requirements given.
